Welcome to the Gym Class Scheduling and Membership Management System backend repository! This project allows trainers, trainees, and admins to manage class schedules, trainer data, and registrations efficiently. With JWT-based authentication and robust CRUD operations, it's a complete backend solution for gym management.
🚀 Features

    Authentication: JWT-based login and registration for trainees.
    Trainer Management: Admin can add, update, and delete trainers.
    Class Scheduling: Admins and trainers can manage class schedules, with validation rules.
    Trainer Dashboard: Trainers can view their class schedules and assigned trainees.
    Validation: Ensure that no more than 5 classes are scheduled per day and that the class duration does not exceed 2 hours.

🛠️ Technology Stack

    Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js
    Database: MongoDB
    Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
    State Management: Redux (for frontend integration)
    API Client: Axios (for API calls)
    Validation: Mongoose validation for schema enforcement

🔧 Installation

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gym-class-scheduler.git
cd gym-class-scheduler

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create a .env file and add the following environment variables:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000

Start the server:

    npm start

📡 API Endpoints
1. Authentication

    POST /api/auth/register
        Register a new trainee
        Fields: email, password, fullName

    POST /api/auth/login
        Login to the system and get a JWT token
        Fields: email, password

2. Admin Routes

    POST /api/admin/trainers
        Add a new trainer (Admin only)
        Fields: name, specialty, experience

    GET /api/admin/trainers
        Fetch all trainers (Admin only)

    PUT /api/admin/trainers/
        Update trainer details (Admin only)
        Fields: name, specialty, experience

    DELETE /api/admin/trainers/
        Delete a trainer (Admin only)

    POST /api/admin/classes
        Add a new class schedule (Admin only)
        Fields: trainerId, className, date, duration

    GET /api/admin/classes
        Fetch all class schedules (Admin only)

3. Trainer Routes

    GET /api/trainer/classes
        Get all classes assigned to the trainer
        Fields: trainerId

🛡️ Security

    JWT Authentication: All sensitive routes are protected with JWT authentication. A token is required to access them.
    Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed before storing them in the database using bcrypt.

⚙️ Validation

    Class Scheduling Rules:
        No more than 5 classes can be scheduled on the same day.
        Each class duration cannot exceed 2 hours.

⚡ Performance Considerations

    Database Indexing: Indexes on frequently queried fields (like date for classes) to improve query performance.
    JWT Expiration: Tokens are set to expire to enhance security. Users need to log in again after expiration.
