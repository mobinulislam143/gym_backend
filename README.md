API Documentation: https://galactic-meteor-270623.postman.co/workspace/33ee6f65-c719-411e-93f8-39980dc985e8/collection/26251659-833ab04c-6eba-418f-a1dc-3a74b13cfeb5

Welcome to the Gym Class Scheduling and Membership Management System backend repository! This project allows trainers, trainees, and admins to manage class schedules, trainer data, and registrations efficiently. With JWT-based authentication and robust CRUD operations, it's a complete backend solution for gym management.
üöÄ Features

    Authentication: JWT-based login and registration for trainees.
    Trainer Management: Admin can add, update, and delete trainers.
    Class Scheduling: Admins and trainers can manage class schedules, with validation rules.
    Trainer Dashboard: Trainers can view their class schedules and assigned trainees.
    Validation: Ensure that no more than 5 classes are scheduled per day and that the class duration does not exceed 2 hours.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

    Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js
    Database: MongoDB
    Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
    State Management: Redux (for frontend integration)
    API Client: Axios (for API calls)
    Validation: Mongoose validation for schema enforcement

Authentication Middleware
AuthMiddleware

    Verifies if the user is authenticated before allowing access to the endpoint
üõ°Ô∏è Security

    JWT Authentication: All sensitive routes are protected with JWT authentication. A token is required to access them.
    Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed before storing them in the database using bcrypt.

‚öôÔ∏è Validation

    Class Scheduling Rules:
        No more than 5 classes can be scheduled on the same day.
        Each class duration cannot exceed 2 hours.

‚ö° Performance Considerations

    Database Indexing: Indexes on frequently queried fields (like date for classes) to improve query performance.
    JWT Expiration: Tokens are set to expire to enhance security. Users need to log in again after expiration.
